        <p>1987 - The beginning
        In Aberdeen, Washington, Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic officially form Nirvana after meeting in their hometown. They play small local venues, make ends meet through low-paying jobs, and experiment with different musical styles influenced by punk and alternative rock. During this period, several drummers come and go, until the lineup solidifies later with Dave Grohl.

        1989 — Debut Album: Bleach
        On June 15, 1989, they release their first studio album, Bleach, under the Sub Pop label. Funded with just 600 dollars, the record captures the raw and abrasive sound of the Pacific Northwest underground. Although it received moderate attention at the time, it would later become a grunge classic.

        1991 - Breakthrough: Nevermind
        On September 24, 1991, Nevermind is released. The impact is immediate: the single “Smells Like Teen Spirit” becomes a generational anthem, and the album knocks Michael Jackson from the number-one spot in U.S. sales. Nirvana goes from an alternative band to a global phenomenon, forever changing the music scene.

        1993 — Creative Return: In Utero
        On September 21, 1993, they release In Utero, produced by Steve Albini. The sound is harsher, more direct, and emotional, moving away from the polished production of Nevermind. Kurt aimed to reclaim the band’s visceral essence: intimate lyrics, sharp guitars, and an unfiltered message. The album receives excellent reviews and is regarded as a masterpiece.

        1994 — Goodbye
        On April 5, 1994, Kurt Cobain dies in Seattle. The impact is global: millions of fans are devastated, and the band officially dissolves shortly afterward. Nirvana’s legacy, however, has only continued to grow. Their music remains alive, influencing new generations and staying relevant more than three decades later.
